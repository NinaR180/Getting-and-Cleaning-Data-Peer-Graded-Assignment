This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on coursera. 

The data was collected from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
This data used a smartphone to measure the movements of the person wearing it. According to the README attached with
the dataset, the measurements were the following:
"- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment."



THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROCESS TO CREATE A TIDY DATA FILE FROM THE RAW DATA:

1) The script reads in the packages which will be necessarry: dplyr and tidyverse 


2) The functions starting with "if(!file.exists..." check if the file has already been downloaded and extracted. 
If not, they download the data from the internet and then extract the .zip folder. 


3)
Note: the dimensions of a subset of the data are in parentheses to the right of the line of the codebook. 
The following few lines (from "activities" to "y_training") assign tables to values, preparing them to be 
combined into one data set, as follows:
activities <- activity_labels.txt (contains list of activities the subjects performed) (6 rows, 2 columns)
features <- features.txt (contains 3-axial signals, measured in degrees) (561 rows, 2 columns)
subject_test <- subject_test.txt (contains testing data of test subjects) (2947 rows, 1 column)
x_test <- X_test.txt (contains features test data) (2947 rows, 561 columns)
y_test <- y_test.txt (contains test data of code labels of the activities) (2947 rows, 1 column)
subject_training <- subject_train.txt (contains training data of test subjects) (7352 rows, 1 column)
x_training <- X_train.txt (contains features train data) (7352 rows, 561 column)
y_training <- y_train.txt (contains train data of code labels of activities)

"x_bound" through "combinedData" perform this combining of data:
x_bound <- rbind(x_training, x_test) (10299 rows, 561 columns)
y_bound <- rbind(y_training, y_test) (10299 rows, 1 column)
subject_bound <- rbind(subject_training, subject_test) (10299 rows, 1 column)
combinedData <- cbind(x_bound, y_bound, subject_bound) (10299 rows, 563 columns)


4) "dataAverages" gets the means and standard deviations of combinedData (10299 rows, 88 columns)

5) the following function ("dataAverages %>% ... ") renames the variables from the data set so that they are 
easier to interpret and therefore analyze.
The new names are to the left of the equal sign, and the old values are to the right, as follows (in alphabetical
order):
	 Accelometer = Acc
 	 Angle = angle
	 Body = BodyBody
	 Frequency = ^f
 	 Gravity = gravity 
	 Gyroscope = Gyro
 	 Magnitude = Mag
	 Mean = mean()
	 Standard Deviation = -std()
	 Time = ^t

6) "tidyData" creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and 
each subject (180 rows, 88 columns) and exports it into a .txt file
